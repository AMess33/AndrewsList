## Description

Andrew's List is a web application that serves as a home improvement marketplace. It allows clients to log in, browse available materials, create projects, and post those projects for contractors to see. Those contractors can then view open projects and submit bids based on the rendered materials list, cost of their labor, etc. The clients can then view the bids for the project and select a contractor.

The application is intended to reduce the amount of time both clients and contractors spend finding each other and planning projects.
